            <h2> Hello! I'm Zane. Welcome to my Personal Website!</h2>

            <h3 id = "engineeringlife">Life as an Engineer</h3>
            <p>I am an electrical computer engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am in the Bachelor Accelerated Masters program in which I am studying embedded software.
            <br><br>
                I have been interesting in engineering for the majority of my life. In high school, I was captain of the robotics team.
                During my freshman year, I worked on a team for a projects class where I learned I am a natural leader. I decided to become a TA for several of my favorite classes such as Digital Logic, RTOS, and Embedded Software Engineering, and most recently the senior design course.
                In the summer of 2023, I worked at Seagate Technology as a Servo Product Development intern. I thoroughly enjoyed this role and I returned for the summer of 2024.
                After my time at Seagate I had an industry connection to Western Digital where I had a firmware engineering internship.
                Most recently I had an internship at Micron as a firmware engineer for SSDs instead of harddrive systems like I had been doing for the previous few years.
                Now I am starting my full-time job search.

        <div class = "about-me">
            <div class="aboutme-content">
            <p>I was born and raised in Gunbarrel, Colorado (about 20 minutes outside of Boulder). I grew up with three dogs: two yellow labs and a german short-haired pointer. 
            <br><br>
                In my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, hanging out with my dogs, and playing video games. My freshman and sophmore years of college, I was the captain of CU's CSGO team. Recently, I have been teaching myself how to pick locks as well!
