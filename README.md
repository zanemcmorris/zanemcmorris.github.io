# Zane McMorri's Portfolio Website
Author: Ari Guzzi

## This project was last edited in January 2024.

## Things that need to be completed:
1. Read through and make sure all the information is accurate and complete. Make sure you like all the styling elements.
2. Replace the place-holder PDF for your resume in the footer.
3. Replace the place-holder PDF for each project in the portfolio section. Update the titles and subtitles to ensure all the information is accurate.
4. Replace the thumbnail photo for each project with an image of the project.
5. Decide if you like your LinkedIn linked in your footer as well as in your header.
6. Get a domain. NameCheap can give you a .me for free for students or pay about $15/year for a .com. I will help you with this :)
